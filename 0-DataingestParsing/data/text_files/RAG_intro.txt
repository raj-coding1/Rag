    Introduction of RAG
    RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation, is an advanced technique in natural language processing that combines information retrieval with text generation. Instead of relying solely on a model’s internal knowledge, RAG retrieves relevant information from external sources—such as documents, databases, or the web—and uses that context to generate more accurate and up-to-date responses. This approach enhances a model’s factual accuracy, reduces hallucinations, and allows it to handle domain-specific or rapidly changing information effectively. RAG is widely used in applications like chatbots, question-answering systems, and knowledge-based assistants.
