Build an in-house AI team\\nWhile outsourced partners with deep technical \\nAI expertise can help you gain that initial \\nmomentum faster, in the long term it will be \\nmore efficient to execute some projects with an \\nin-house AI team. Further, you will want to keep \\nsome projects within the company to build a \\nmore unique competitive advantage.\\nIt is important to have buy-in from the C-suite \\nto build this internal team. During the rise of \\nthe internet, hiring a CIO was a turning point for \\nmany companies to have a cohesive strategy for \\nusing the internet. In contrast, the companies \\nthat ran many independent experiments—\\nranging from digital marketing to data science \\nexperiments to new website launches—failed to \\nleverage internet capabilities if these small pilot \\nprojects did not manage to scale to transform \\nthe rest of the company.\\nIn the AI era, a key moment for many companies \\nwill again be the formation of a centralized AI \\nteam that can help the whole company.

It could also be led by \\na dedicated CAIO (Chief AI Officer). \\nThe key responsibilities of the AI unit are:\\n•\\u2002Build up an AI capability to support the whole \\ncompany. \\n•\\u2002Execute an initial sequence of cross-functional \\nprojects to support different divisions/business \\nunits with AI projects.

Since \\nthe talent war is largely zero-sum in the short \\nterm, working with a recruiting partner that can \\nhelp you build an AI team will give you a non-\\ntrivial advantage. However, providing training \\nto your existing team can also be a good way to \\ncreate a lot of new talent in-house. \\n3. Provide broad AI training\\nNo company today has enough in-house AI talent. \\nWhile the media reports of high AI salaries are \\nover-hyped (the numbers quoted in press tend to \\nbe outliers), AI talent is hard to find. Fortunately, \\nwith the rise of digital content, including MOOCs \\n(massive open online courses) such as Coursera, \\nebooks, and YouTube videos, it is more cost \\neffective than ever to train up large numbers of \\nemployees in new skills such as AI. The smart \\nCLO (Chief Learning Officer) knows that their \\njob is to curate, rather than create content, and \\nthen to establish processes to ensure employees \\ncomplete the learning experiences. \\nTen years ago, employee training meant hiring \\nconsultants to come to your office to give \\nlectures. But this was inefficient, and the ROI was \\nunclear. In contrast, digital content is much more \\naffordable and also gives employees a more \\npersonalized experience. If you do have the budget \\nto hire consultants, the in-person content should \\ncomplement the online content. (This is called the \\n“flipped classroom” pedagogy. I have found that, \\nwhen implemented correctly, this results in faster \\nlearning and a more enjoyable learning experience. \\nFor example, at Stanford University, my on-campus \\ndeep learning class is taught using this form of \\npedagogy.) Hiring a few AI experts to deliver some \\nin-person content can also help motivate your \\nemployees to learn these AI techniques. \\nAI will transform many different jobs. You should \\ngive everyone the knowledge they will need to \\nadapt to their new roles in the AI era. Consulting \\nwith an expert will allow you to develop a \\ncustomized curriculum for your team. \\nHowever, a notional education plan may look like \\nthis: \\n1. Executives and senior business leaders: \\n(≥4 hours training) \\nGOAL: \\nEnable executives to understand what AI can \\ndo for your enterprise, begin developing AI \\nstrategy, make appropriate resource allocation \\ndecisions, and collaborate smoothly with an AI \\nteam that is supporting valuable AI projects. \\nCURRICULUM: \\n•\\u2002Basic business understanding of AI including \\nbasic technology, data, and what AI can and \\ncannot do.\\n•\\u2002Understanding of AI’s impact on corporate \\nstrategy.\\n•\\u2002Case studies on AI applications to adjacent \\nindustries or to your specific industry.\\n2.

Develop an AI strategy\\nAn AI strategy will guide your company toward \\ncreating value while also building defensible \\nmoats. Once teams start to see the success \\nof the initial AI projects and form a deeper \\nunderstanding of AI, you will be able to identify \\nthe places where AI can create the most value \\nand focus resources on those areas. \\nSome executives will think that developing \\nan AI strategy should be the first step. In my \\nexperience, most companies will not be able to \\ndevelop a thoughtful AI strategy until it has had \\nsome basic experience with AI, which partial \\nprogress in steps 1-3 will give you. \\nThe way you build defensible moats is also \\nevolving with AI. Here are some approaches to \\nconsider: \\nBuild several difficult AI assets that are \\nbroadly aligned with a coherent strategy: \\nAI is enabling companies to build unique \\ncompetitive advantages in new ways. Michael \\nPorter’s seminal writings on business strategy \\nshow that one way to start a defensible business\\nis to build several difficult assets that are broadly \\naligned with a coherent strategy. It thus becomes \\ndifficult for a competitor to replicate all of these \\nassets simultaneously.\\nLeverage AI to create an advantage specific \\nto your industry sector: Rather than trying \\nto compete “generally” in AI with leading tech \\ncompanies such as Google, I recommend \\ninstead becoming a leading AI company in your \\nindustry sector, where developing unique AI \\ncapabilities will allow you to gain a competitive \\nadvantage. How AI affects your company’s \\nstrategy will be industry- and situation-specific. \\nDesign strategies aligned with the “Virtuous \\nCycle of AI” positive-feedback loop: In many \\nindustries, we will see data accumulation \\nleading to a defensible business:\\nFor example, leading web search engines such \\nas Google, Baidu, Bing and Yandex have a huge \\ndata asset showing them what links a user clicks \\non after different search queries. This data \\nhelps the companies build a more accurate \\nsearch engine product (A), which in turn helps \\nthem acquire more users (B), which in turn \\nresults in their having even more user data (C).\\nThis positive feedback loop is hard for \\ncompetitors to break into.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.2 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2024-02-23T14:55:51-05:00', 'moddate': '2024-02-23T14:57:41-05:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/pdf_files/AI_Transformation_Playbook.pdf', 'total_pages': 6, 'page': 4, 'page_label': '5'}, page_content='© DeepLearning.AI  All rights reserved. | deeplearning.ai 5\\nData is a key asset for AI systems. Thus, many \\ngreat AI companies also have a sophisticated  \\ndata strategy. Key elements of your data \\nstrategy may include: \\nStrategic data acquisition: Useful AI \\nsystems can be built with anywhere from \\n100 data points (“small data”) to 100,000,000 \\ndata points (“big data”). But having more \\ndata almost never hurts. AI teams are using \\nvery sophisticated, multi-year strategies to \\nacquire data, and specific data acquisition \\nstrategies are industry- and situation-specific. \\nFor example, Google and Baidu both have \\nnumerous free products that do not monetize \\nbut allow them to acquire data that can be \\nmonetized elsewhere.\\nUnified data warehouses: If you have 50 \\ndifferent databases siloed under the control \\nof 50 different VPs or divisions, it will be nearly \\nimpossible for an engineer or for AI software \\nto get access to this data and “connect the \\ndots.” Instead, consider centralizing your data \\ninto one or at most a small number of data \\nwarehouses.\\nRecognize what data is valuable, and \\nwhat is not: It is not true that having many \\nterabytes of data automatically means an \\nAI team will be able to create value from \\nthat data. Expecting an AI team to magically \\ncreate value from a large dataset is a formula \\nthat comes with a high chance of failure, \\nand I have tragically seen CEOs over-invest \\nin collecting low-value data, or even acquire \\na company for its data only to realize the \\ntarget company’s many terabytes of data is \\nnot useful. Avoid this mistake by bringing an \\nAI team in early during your process of data \\nacquisition, and let them help you prioritize \\nwhat types of data to acquire and save. \\nCreate network effect and platform \\nadvantages: Finally, AI can also be used to \\nbuild more traditional moats. For example, \\nplatforms with network effects are highly \\ndefensible businesses. They often have a \\nnatural “winner takes all” dynamic that forces \\ncompanies to either grow fast or die. If AI \\nallows you to acquire users faster than your \\ncompetitors, it could be leveraged into building \\na moat that is defensible through platform \\ndynamics. More broadly, you can also use AI \\nas a key component of low cost strategy, high \\nvalue, or other business strategies.\\n5.  Develop internal and external \\ncommunications\\nAI will affect your business significantly. To the \\nextent that it affects your key stakeholders, \\nyou should run a communications program \\nto ensure alignment. Here is what you should \\nconsider for each audience:\\nInvestor Relations: Leading AI companies \\nsuch as Google and Baidu are now much more \\nvaluable companies in part because of their AI \\ncapabilities and the impact that AI has on their \\nbottom lines. Explaining a clear value creation \\nthesis for AI in your company, describing your \\ngrowing AI capabilities, and having a thoughtful \\nAI strategy, will help investors value your \\ncompany appropriately. \\nGovernment Relations: Companies in \\nhighly regulated industries (self-driving cars, \\nhealthcare) face unique challenges to stay \\ncompliant. Developing a credible, compelling \\nAI story that explains the value and benefits \\nyour project can bring to an industry or society, \\nis an important step in building trust and \\ngoodwill. This should be coupled with direct \\ncommunication and ongoing dialogue with \\nregulators as you rollout your project. \\nCustomer/User Education: AI will likely bring \\nsignificant benefits to your customers, so make \\nsure the appropriate marketing and product \\nroadmap messages are disseminated. \\nTalent/Recruitment: Because of the scarcity \\nof AI talent, strong employer branding will have \\na significant effect on your ability to attract and \\nretain such talent. AI engineers want to work \\non exciting and meaningful projects. A modest \\neffort to showcase your initial successes can go \\na long way.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.2 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2024-02-23T14:55:51-05:00', 'moddate': '2024-02-23T14:57:41-05:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/pdf_files/AI_Transformation_Playbook.pdf', 'total_pages': 6, 'page': 5, 'page_label': '6'}, page_content='© DeepLearning.AI  All rights reserved. | deeplearning.ai 6\\nInternal Communications: Because AI today \\nis still poorly understood and Artificial General \\nIntelligence specifically has been over-hyped, \\nthere is fear, uncertainty and doubt. Many \\nemployees are also concerned about their \\njobs being automated by AI, though this varies \\nwidely by culture (for example, this fear appears \\nmuch more in the US than in Japan). Clear \\ninternal communications both to explain AI \\nand to address such employees’ concerns will \\nreduce any internal reluctance to adopt AI. \\nA historical note, important for \\nyour success\\nUnderstanding how the internet transformed \\nindustries is useful for navigating the rise of AI. \\nThere is a mistake that many businesses made \\nnavigating the rise of the internet that I hope \\nyou will avoid as you navigate the rise of AI.\\nWe learned in the internet era that:\\nShopping Mall + Website ≠ internet company\\n \\nEven if a shopping mall built a website and sold \\nthings on a website, that by itself did not turn \\nthe shopping mall into a true internet company. \\nWhat defines a true internet company is: Have \\nyou organized your company to do the things \\nthat the internet lets you do really well? \\nFor example, internet companies engage in \\npervasive A/B testing, in which we routinely \\nlaunch two versions of a website and measure \\nwhich works better. An internet company may \\neven have hundreds of experiments running \\nat the same time; this is very hard to do with a \\nphysical shopping mall. Internet companies can \\nalso ship a new product every week and thus \\nlearn much faster than a shopping mall that \\nmight update its design only once per quarter. \\nInternet companies have unique job descriptions \\nfor roles such as product manager and software \\nengineer, and those jobs have unique workflows \\nand processes for how they work together. \\nDeep learning, one of the fastest growing areas \\nof AI, is showing parallels to the rise of the \\ninternet. Today, we find that: \\nAny typical company + Deep Learning \\ntechnology ≠  AI company \\nFor your company to become great at AI, you \\nwill have to organize your company to do the \\nthings that AI lets you do really well. \\nFor your company to be great at AI,  you \\nmust have:\\nResources to systematically execute \\non multiple valuable AI projects: AI \\ncompanies have the outsourced and/or in-\\nhouse technology and talent to systematically \\nexecute on multiple AI projects that deliver \\ndirect value to the business.\\nSufficient understanding of AI: There \\nshould be general understanding of AI, \\nwith appropriate processes in place to \\nsystematically identify and select valuable AI \\nprojects to work on.\\nStrategic direction: The company’s strategy \\nis broadly aligned to succeed in an AI-\\npowered future. \\nTurning your great company into a great \\nAI company is challenging but feasible with \\nthe support of great partners. My team at \\nDeepLearning AI is committed to helping \\npartners with their AI transformations, and I will \\ncontinue to share additional best practices. \\nAn AI Transformation program may take 2-3 \\nyears, but you should expect to see initial concrete \\nresults within 6-12 months.

With two \\nsuccesses, I started conversations with the \\nadvertising team. Building up momentum \\ngradually led to more and more successful AI \\nprojects. This process is a repeatable model that \\nyou can use in your company.\\n2. Build an in-house AI team\\nWhile outsourced partners with deep technical \\nAI expertise can help you gain that initial \\nmomentum faster, in the long term it will be \\nmore efficient to execute some projects with an \\nin-house AI team. Further, you will want to keep \\nsome projects within the company to build a \\nmore unique competitive advantage.\\nIt is important to have buy-in from the C-suite \\nto build this internal team. During the rise of \\nthe internet, hiring a CIO was a turning point for \\nmany companies to have a cohesive strategy for \\nusing the internet. In contrast, the companies \\nthat ran many independent experiments—\\nranging from digital marketing to data science \\nexperiments to new website launches—failed to \\nleverage internet capabilities if these small pilot \\nprojects did not manage to scale to transform \\nthe rest of the company.\\nIn the AI era, a key moment for many companies \\nwill again be the formation of a centralized AI \\nteam that can help the whole company. This AI \\nteam could sit under the CTO, CIO, or CDO (Chief \\nData Officer or Chief Digital Officer) function if \\nthey have the right skillset. It could also be led by \\na dedicated CAIO (Chief AI Officer). \\nThe key responsibilities of the AI unit are:\\n•\\u2002Build up an AI capability to support the whole \\ncompany. \\n•\\u2002Execute an initial sequence of cross-functional \\nprojects to support different divisions/business \\nunits with AI projects.

Since \\nthe talent war is largely zero-sum in the short \\nterm, working with a recruiting partner that can \\nhelp you build an AI team will give you a non-\\ntrivial advantage. However, providing training \\nto your existing team can also be a good way to \\ncreate a lot of new talent in-house. \\n3. Provide broad AI training\\nNo company today has enough in-house AI talent. \\nWhile the media reports of high AI salaries are \\nover-hyped (the numbers quoted in press tend to \\nbe outliers), AI talent is hard to find. Fortunately, \\nwith the rise of digital content, including MOOCs \\n(massive open online courses) such as Coursera, \\nebooks, and YouTube videos, it is more cost \\neffective than ever to train up large numbers of \\nemployees in new skills such as AI. The smart \\nCLO (Chief Learning Officer) knows that their \\njob is to curate, rather than create content, and \\nthen to establish processes to ensure employees \\ncomplete the learning experiences. \\nTen years ago, employee training meant hiring \\nconsultants to come to your office to give \\nlectures. But this was inefficient, and the ROI was \\nunclear. In contrast, digital content is much more \\naffordable and also gives employees a more \\npersonalized experience. If you do have the budget \\nto hire consultants, the in-person content should \\ncomplement the online content. (This is called the \\n“flipped classroom” pedagogy. I have found that, \\nwhen implemented correctly, this results in faster \\nlearning and a more enjoyable learning experience. \\nFor example, at Stanford University, my on-campus \\ndeep learning class is taught using this form of \\npedagogy.) Hiring a few AI experts to deliver some \\nin-person content can also help motivate your \\nemployees to learn these AI techniques. \\nAI will transform many different jobs. You should \\ngive everyone the knowledge they will need to \\nadapt to their new roles in the AI era. Consulting \\nwith an expert will allow you to develop a \\ncustomized curriculum for your team. \\nHowever, a notional education plan may look like \\nthis: \\n1.\\t Executives and senior business leaders: \\n(≥4 hours training) \\nGOAL: \\nEnable executives to understand what AI can \\ndo for your enterprise, begin developing AI \\nstrategy, make appropriate resource allocation \\ndecisions, and collaborate smoothly with an AI \\nteam that is supporting valuable AI projects. \\nCURRICULUM: \\n•\\u2002Basic business understanding of AI including \\nbasic technology, data, and what AI can and \\ncannot do.\\n•\\u2002Understanding of AI’s impact on corporate \\nstrategy.\\n•\\u2002Case studies on AI applications to adjacent \\nindustries or to your specific industry.\\n2.\\t Leaders of divisions carrying out AI \\nprojects: (≥12 hours training)\\nGOAL: \\nDivision leaders should be able to set direction \\nfor AI projects, allocate resources, monitor and \\ntrack progress, and make corrections as needed \\nto ensure successful project delivery. \\nCURRICULUM:\\n•\\u2002Basic business understanding of AI including \\nbasic technology, data, and what AI can and \\ncannot do. \\n•\\u2002Basic technical understanding of AI, including \\nmajor classes of algorithms and their \\nrequirements.\\n•\\u2002Basic understanding of the workflow \\nand processes of AI projects, roles \\nand responsibilities in AI teams, and \\nmanagement of AI team.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.2 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2024-02-23T14:55:51-05:00', 'source': 'data/pdf_files/AI_Transformation_Playbook.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/pdf_files/AI_Transformation_Playbook.pdf', 'total_pages': 6, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-02-23T14:57:41-05:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20240223145741-05'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20240223145551-05'00'\", 'page': 3}, page_content='© DeepLearning.AI  All rights reserved. | deeplearning.ai\\n4\\n3.\\tAI engineer trainees:  \\n(≥100 hours training) \\nGOAL: \\nNewly trained AI engineers should be able to \\ngather data, train AI models, and deliver specific \\nAI projects. \\nCURRICULUM:\\n•\\u2002Deep technical understanding of machine \\nlearning and deep learning; basic understanding \\nof other AI tools. \\n•\\u2002Understanding of available (open-source and \\nother 3rd party) tools for building AI and data \\nsystems. \\n•\\u2002Ability to implement AI teams’ workflow and \\nprocesses. \\n•\\u2002Additionally: Ongoing education to keep up-\\nto-date with evolving AI technology\\n4. Develop an AI strategy\\nAn AI strategy will guide your company toward \\ncreating value while also building defensible \\nmoats. Once teams start to see the success \\nof the initial AI projects and form a deeper \\nunderstanding of AI, you will be able to identify \\nthe places where AI can create the most value \\nand focus resources on those areas. \\nSome executives will think that developing \\nan AI strategy should be the first step. In my \\nexperience, most companies will not be able to \\ndevelop a thoughtful AI strategy until it has had \\nsome basic experience with AI, which partial \\nprogress in steps 1-3 will give you. \\nThe way you build defensible moats is also \\nevolving with AI. Here are some approaches to \\nconsider: \\nBuild several difficult AI assets that are \\nbroadly aligned with a coherent strategy: \\nAI is enabling companies to build unique \\ncompetitive advantages in new ways. Michael \\nPorter’s seminal writings on business strategy \\nshow that one way to start a defensible business\\nis to build several difficult assets that are broadly \\naligned with a coherent strategy. It thus becomes \\ndifficult for a competitor to replicate all of these \\nassets simultaneously.\\nLeverage AI to create an advantage specific \\nto your industry sector: Rather than trying \\nto compete “generally” in AI with leading tech \\ncompanies such as Google, I recommend \\ninstead becoming a leading AI company in your \\nindustry sector, where developing unique AI \\ncapabilities will allow you to gain a competitive \\nadvantage. How AI affects your company’s \\nstrategy will be industry- and situation-specific. \\nDesign strategies aligned with the “Virtuous \\nCycle of AI” positive-feedback loop: In many \\nindustries, we will see data accumulation \\nleading to a defensible business:\\nFor example, leading web search engines such \\nas Google, Baidu, Bing and Yandex have a huge \\ndata asset showing them what links a user clicks \\non after different search queries. This data \\nhelps the companies build a more accurate \\nsearch engine product (A), which in turn helps \\nthem acquire more users (B), which in turn \\nresults in their having even more user data (C).\\nThis positive feedback loop is hard for \\ncompetitors to break into.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.2 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2024-02-23T14:55:51-05:00', 'source': 'data/pdf_files/AI_Transformation_Playbook.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/pdf_files/AI_Transformation_Playbook.pdf', 'total_pages': 6, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-02-23T14:57:41-05:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20240223145741-05'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20240223145551-05'00'\", 'page': 4}, page_content='© DeepLearning.AI  All rights reserved. | deeplearning.ai\\n5\\nData is a key asset for AI systems. Thus, many \\ngreat AI companies also have a sophisticated  \\ndata strategy. Key elements of your data \\nstrategy may include: \\nStrategic data acquisition: Useful AI \\nsystems can be built with anywhere from \\n100 data points (“small data”) to 100,000,000 \\ndata points (“big data”). But having more \\ndata almost never hurts. AI teams are using \\nvery sophisticated, multi-year strategies to \\nacquire data, and specific data acquisition \\nstrategies are industry- and situation-specific. \\nFor example, Google and Baidu both have \\nnumerous free products that do not monetize \\nbut allow them to acquire data that can be \\nmonetized elsewhere.\\nUnified data warehouses: If you have 50 \\ndifferent databases siloed under the control \\nof 50 different VPs or divisions, it will be nearly \\nimpossible for an engineer or for AI software \\nto get access to this data and “connect the \\ndots.” Instead, consider centralizing your data \\ninto one or at most a small number of data \\nwarehouses.\\nRecognize what data is valuable, and \\nwhat is not: It is not true that having many \\nterabytes of data automatically means an \\nAI team will be able to create value from \\nthat data. Expecting an AI team to magically \\ncreate value from a large dataset is a formula \\nthat comes with a high chance of failure, \\nand I have tragically seen CEOs over-invest \\nin collecting low-value data, or even acquire \\na company for its data only to realize the \\ntarget company’s many terabytes of data is \\nnot useful. Avoid this mistake by bringing an \\nAI team in early during your process of data \\nacquisition, and let them help you prioritize \\nwhat types of data to acquire and save. \\nCreate network effect and platform \\nadvantages: Finally, AI can also be used to \\nbuild more traditional moats. For example, \\nplatforms with network effects are highly \\ndefensible businesses. They often have a \\nnatural “winner takes all” dynamic that forces \\ncompanies to either grow fast or die. If AI \\nallows you to acquire users faster than your \\ncompetitors, it could be leveraged into building \\na moat that is defensible through platform \\ndynamics. More broadly, you can also use AI \\nas a key component of low cost strategy, high \\nvalue, or other business strategies.\\n5. \\x07Develop internal and external \\ncommunications\\nAI will affect your business significantly. To the \\nextent that it affects your key stakeholders, \\nyou should run a communications program \\nto ensure alignment. Here is what you should \\nconsider for each audience:\\nInvestor Relations: Leading AI companies \\nsuch as Google and Baidu are now much more \\nvaluable companies in part because of their AI \\ncapabilities and the impact that AI has on their \\nbottom lines. Explaining a clear value creation \\nthesis for AI in your company, describing your \\ngrowing AI capabilities, and having a thoughtful \\nAI strategy, will help investors value your \\ncompany appropriately. \\nGovernment Relations: Companies in \\nhighly regulated industries (self-driving cars, \\nhealthcare) face unique challenges to stay \\ncompliant. Developing a credible, compelling \\nAI story that explains the value and benefits \\nyour project can bring to an industry or society, \\nis an important step in building trust and \\ngoodwill. This should be coupled with direct \\ncommunication and ongoing dialogue with \\nregulators as you rollout your project. \\nCustomer/User Education: AI will likely bring \\nsignificant benefits to your customers, so make \\nsure the appropriate marketing and product \\nroadmap messages are disseminated. \\nTalent/Recruitment: Because of the scarcity \\nof AI talent, strong employer branding will have \\na significant effect on your ability to attract and \\nretain such talent. AI engineers want to work \\non exciting and meaningful projects. A modest \\neffort to showcase your initial successes can go \\na long way.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.2 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2024-02-23T14:55:51-05:00', 'source': 'data/pdf_files/AI_Transformation_Playbook.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/pdf_files/AI_Transformation_Playbook.pdf', 'total_pages': 6, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-02-23T14:57:41-05:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20240223145741-05'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20240223145551-05'00'\", 'page': 5}, page_content='© DeepLearning.AI  All rights reserved. | deeplearning.ai\\n6\\nInternal Communications: Because AI today \\nis still poorly understood and Artificial General \\nIntelligence specifically has been over-hyped, \\nthere is fear, uncertainty and doubt. Many \\nemployees are also concerned about their \\njobs being automated by AI, though this varies \\nwidely by culture (for example, this fear appears \\nmuch more in the US than in Japan). Clear \\ninternal communications both to explain AI \\nand to address such employees’ concerns will \\nreduce any internal reluctance to adopt AI. \\nA historical note, important for \\nyour success\\nUnderstanding how the internet transformed \\nindustries is useful for navigating the rise of AI. \\nThere is a mistake that many businesses made \\nnavigating the rise of the internet that I hope \\nyou will avoid as you navigate the rise of AI.\\nWe learned in the internet era that:\\nShopping Mall + Website ≠ internet company\\n \\nEven if a shopping mall built a website and sold \\nthings on a website, that by itself did not turn \\nthe shopping mall into a true internet company. \\nWhat defines a true internet company is: Have \\nyou organized your company to do the things \\nthat the internet lets you do really well? \\nFor example, internet companies engage in \\npervasive A/B testing, in which we routinely \\nlaunch two versions of a website and measure \\nwhich works better. An internet company may \\neven have hundreds of experiments running \\nat the same time; this is very hard to do with a \\nphysical shopping mall.
